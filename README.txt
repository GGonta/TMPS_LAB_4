This Java code demonstrates a simple Traffic Light System using three behavioral design patterns: Observer, Command, and State.

Observer pattern: The Observer pattern is used to create a subscription mechanism where an object (subscriber) listens for changes in the state of another object (publisher) and is notified when the state changes. In this example, the TrafficLight class is the publisher, and the TrafficLightObserver interface represents the subscribers.

Command pattern: The Command pattern is used to encapsulate actions (or requests) as objects, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests. In this example, the Command interface is used to create a ChangeStateCommand class, which takes a TrafficLight instance and the new state it should change to.

State pattern: The State pattern is used to allow an object to change its behavior based on its internal state. In this example, the TrafficLightState interface and its implementations (RedState, YellowState, and GreenState) represent the different states of a traffic light.

In the Main class, a TrafficLight object is created, and an observer (a lambda expression) is added to it. The observer simply prints the new color of the traffic light whenever the state changes. Next, three ChangeStateCommand objects are created to change the traffic light to red, yellow, and green states. The commands are then executed, resulting in state changes and observer notifications.

This code demonstrates how to use Observer, Command, and State design patterns in a simple Java project. These patterns can help make the code more modular, maintainable, and extensible.
